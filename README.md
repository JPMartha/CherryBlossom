## Getting Started

The first step to use **CherryBlossom** is to set the `TOOLCHAIN_VERSION` in the `Makefile`.

- e.g. `2016-03-24-a`
  
If you try to develop the Swift Package Manager, set the `SWIFTPM_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTORY` in the `Makefile`.

- e.g. `$(HOME)/swift-package-manager`

<br />

## For Swift 3.0

### Installing Development Snapshot

Download and install Swift from [Swift.org](https://swift.org).

```bash
$ make swift-install
```

For more information, see the [Download Swift](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots).

<br />

### Managing Swift Environments

Set your `PATH` and `TOOLCHAINS` environment variables.

```bash
$ cd <your-cherryblossom-directory>
$ . scripts/set-swift-env
```

For more information, see [https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-03-24-a#managing-swift-environments).

<br />

## For the Swift Package Manager

### Rebuilding The Swift Package Manager

Rebuild the Swift Package Manager itself with the bootstrap script.

```bash
$ make swiftpm-rebuild
```

<br />

> _**‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE NOTE!**_
>
> _**OVERRIDE your `swift-build` and your `swift-test` in the `SWIFTPM_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTORY` which you set in the `Makefile`.**_

If you want to revert, run `$ make swift-install` again. üíÅ

<br />

For more information, see [https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-03-24-a#development).

<br />

### Testing The Swift Package Manager

Test the Swift Package Manager itself with the bootstrap script after rebuilding.

```bash
$ make swiftpm-test
```

An error has occured without building.

```bash
error: unable to find 'swift-build-tool' tool for bootstrap build
```

For more information, see [https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-03-24-a#contributing).

<br />

## Options

If your current directory is not the CherryBlossom directory, set it with `-C` option.

Change to the directory before doing anything.

```bash
$ make swiftpm-rebuild -C <your-cherryblossom-directory>
```
